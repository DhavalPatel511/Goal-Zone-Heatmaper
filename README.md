# Goal Zone Heatmapper Project

## Overview:

The Goal Zone Heatmapper project focuses on creating an interactive heatmap to visualize player statistics and strike coordinates on a football pitch. The project utilizes Python, BeautifulSoup for web scraping, and Seaborn for advanced data visualization. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of player performance within the goal zone through precise data extraction, transformation, and engaging visual representation.

## Key Features:

1. **Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup:**
   - Leveraged BeautifulSoup in Python for precise extraction of player statistics directly from the website source code.
   - Gathered raw data for subsequent analysis.

2. **Data Transformation and Structuring:**
   - Transformed raw data into a structured CSV format, enhancing accessibility and usability for further analysis.
   - Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data exploration and manipulation, extracting actionable insights from extensive datasets.

3. **Goal Zone Heatmap Visualization:**
   - Innovatively translated raw player strike coordinates and football pitch dimensions into an engaging heatmap.
   - Demonstrated comprehensive data visualization skills using Seaborn.

4. **Integrated Workflow:**
   - Seamlessly integrated web scraping, data transformation, and advanced visualization, showcasing a profound skill set in data utilization.
   - Created a cohesive and efficient workflow from data extraction to visualization.

## Code and Usage:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Goal-Zone-Heatmapper.git
   cd Goal-Zone-Heatmapper
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy seaborn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Explore the Jupyter notebook or Python script to understand the workflow.
   - Update the website URL in the code for your desired player statistics source.
   - Execute the script to perform web scraping, data transformation, and generate the Goal Zone Heatmap.

## Results:

The project delivers a visually appealing Goal Zone Heatmap, allowing users to explore and analyze player performance within the goal zone. The heatmap provides insights into player strike coordinates and facilitates a deeper understanding of their effectiveness in scoring goals.
